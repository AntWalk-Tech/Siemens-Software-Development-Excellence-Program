void ProcessOrder(Order order)
{
    // code A
    // code B
    // code C
    // code D
    // code E
    // code F
    // code G
    // code H
    // code I
}


//In this example, the method ProcessOrder is too long, it has many lines of code and it's difficult to understand the purpose of the method, this is considered as a code smell.
