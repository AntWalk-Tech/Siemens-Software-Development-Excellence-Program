class OrderProcessor
{
    // properties
    // method A
    // method B
    // method C
    // method D
    // method E
    // method F
    // method G
    // method H
}

//In this example, the class OrderProcessor has many methods, it's difficult to understand the responsibility of the class, this is considered as a code smell.
