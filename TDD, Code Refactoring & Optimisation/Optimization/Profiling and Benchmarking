// This involves measuring the performance of a program and identifying bottlenecks. 
// This can be achieved by using profiling tools such as the Stopwatch class in C# and benchmarking tools such as the PerfomanceCounter class in C#.


    //Example of using profiling and benchmarking
    public void ProcessLargeData(List<int> data)
    {
        var stopwatch = new Stopwatch();
        stopwatch.Start();
        //Process data
        stopwatch.Stop();
        Console.WriteLine("Time taken: " + stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds);
    }
