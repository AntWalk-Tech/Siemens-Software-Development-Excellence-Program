// This involves reducing the amount of memory used by a program. 
// This can be achieved by reusing memory, allocating memory dynamically, or by using data structures that use less memory.

    //Example of reducing memory usage
    public void ProcessLargeData(List<int> data)
    {
        int[] arr = data.ToArray();
        //Converting list to array can reduce memory usage
    }
