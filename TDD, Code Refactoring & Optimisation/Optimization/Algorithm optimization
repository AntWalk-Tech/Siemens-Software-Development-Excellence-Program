// This involves selecting the most efficient algorithm for a specific task. 
// For example, using a sorting algorithm with a time complexity of O(n log n) instead of one with a time complexity of O(n^2) can greatly improve the performance of a program.

    //Example of using the most efficient algorithm
    public void SortArray(int[] arr)
    {
        //Using quicksort algorithm 
        Array.Sort(arr);
    }
