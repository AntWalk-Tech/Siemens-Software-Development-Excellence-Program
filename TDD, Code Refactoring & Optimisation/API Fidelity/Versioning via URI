<!-- // Versioning via URI: This approach involves including the version number in the URI of the API endpoint. For example, a version 1 endpoint might be accessed at https://example.com/api/v1/users, while a version 2 endpoint might be accessed at https://example.com/api/v2/users. In this way, consumers can continue to use the older version of the API while also taking advantage of new features and improvements in the newer version. -->
