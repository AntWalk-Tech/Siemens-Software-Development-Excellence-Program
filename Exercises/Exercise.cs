//Exercise Questions

// 1. Consider a system that needs to manage a large number of bank accounts. Design a clean, maintainable and efficient solution for handling account transactions, taking into account the following constraints:
//Transactions can be of multiple types, such as deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
//Each transaction must be atomic, meaning it must either complete successfully or fail without leaving any side effects.
//The system must handle concurrent transactions on the same account without causing any race conditions.

// 2. Create a class hierarchy for representing a library catalog system. The catalog should be able to store books, journals, and periodicals. The classes should be designed in such a way that they are open for extension but closed for modification. The catalog should be able to search for items based on title, author, and publication date. Additionally, the catalog should be able to generate reports of the items in the catalog in various formats such as CSV, JSON and XML.

// 3. Design a system for a supermarket checkout counter that can scan products, apply discounts, and calculate the total cost of the purchase. The system should be able to handle multiple types of discounts, such as buy-one-get-one-free, bulk discounts, and coupon discounts. The system should also be able to handle multiple types of products, such as weight-based products and unit-based products. Additionally, the system should be able to handle different types of payments, such as cash, credit card, and gift card.

// 4. Create a program that simulates a traffic light control system for a four-way intersection. The program should be able to handle different types of traffic, such as cars, trucks, bicycles, and pedestrians. The program should also be able to handle different traffic patterns, such as rush hour and non-peak hours. The program should also be able to handle different weather conditions, such as rain and snow. Additionally, the program should be able to handle emergency vehicles, such as ambulances and fire trucks, and give them priority over other traffic.

// 5. Design a system for a warehouse management system that can track the movement of products in the warehouse. The system should be able to handle multiple types of products, such as perishable goods and non-perishable goods. The system should also be able to handle different storage conditions, such as temperature-controlled storage and regular storage. The system should also be able to handle different types of movement, such as receiving, picking, packing, and shipping. Additionally, the system should be able to generate reports on the movement of products in the warehouse.
