//Hungarian Notation restates the type which is already present in the declaration. This is pointless since modern IDEs will identify the type.

//Bad:

int iCounter;
string strFullName;
DateTime dModifiedDate;
//Good:

int counter;
string fullName;
DateTime modifiedDate;
Hungarian Notation should also not be used in paramaters.

//Bad:

public bool IsShopOpen(string pDay, int pAmount)
{
    // some logic
}
//Good:

public bool IsShopOpen(string day, int amount)
{
    // some logic
}
