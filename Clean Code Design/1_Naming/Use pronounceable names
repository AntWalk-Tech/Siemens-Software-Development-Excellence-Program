//It will take time to investigate the meaning of the variables and functions when they are not pronounceable.

//Bad:

public class Employee
{
    public Datetime sWorkDate { get; set; } // what the heck is this
    public Datetime modTime { get; set; } // same here
}



//Good:

public class Employee
{
    public Datetime StartWorkingDate { get; set; }
    public Datetime ModificationTime { get; set; }
}
