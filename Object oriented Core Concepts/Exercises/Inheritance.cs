// Exercise 1: Define a base class Shape with a method CalculateArea() that calculates the area of the shape and a property Width and Height. 
// Now create a derived class Rectangle and Circle which inherits from the base class Shape and override the CalculateArea() method to provide the appropriate calculation for their shape.


// Exercise 2: Define a base class Animal with a method Move() and a derived class Mammal and Bird which inherits from the base class Animals. 
// Now override the Move() method in the derived class to provide the appropriate behavior for their type of animal.


// Exercise 3: Define a base class Employee with properties such as name, age, and salary. 
// Now create a derived class Manager which inherits from the base class Employee and has an additional property for the number of employees they manage.
