// Exercise 1: Create an abstract class called Shape with an abstract method called Draw and a private field _color. 
// Now create two classes called Rectangle and Circle that inherit from the Shape class. 
// Override the Draw method in each child class to draw a rectangle and a circle respectively. 
// In main method create an array of Shape objects, instantiate a rectangle and a circle, and add them to the array. 
// Then call the Draw method on each object in the array.






// Exercise 2: Create an interface called ICalculator with a method called Calculate that takes two integers as arguments and returns an integer. 
// Now create two classes called Addition and Multiplication that implement the ICalculator interface. 
// Override the Calculate method in each class to perform addition and multiplication respectively. 
// In main method create an array of ICalculator objects, instantiate an addition and a multiplication object, and add them to the array. 
// Then call the Calculate method on each object in the array passing the values 2 and 3.
