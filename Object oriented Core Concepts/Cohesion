//Cohesion is a measure of how closely the elements of a module or class are related to each other
//A class or module that has high cohesion has elements that are all related to the same purpose
//High cohesion is desirable because it makes the code more readable, maintainable, and reusable, as it allows for a clear separation of concerns.
