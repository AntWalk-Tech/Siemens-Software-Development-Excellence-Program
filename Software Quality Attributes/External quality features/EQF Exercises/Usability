// Exercise: Refactor the following code to improve its usability

class A
{
    public void ProcessOrder(string orderId)
    {
        // code to process the order
    }
}


// Solution
class A
{
    public void ProcessOrder(int orderId)
    {
        // code to process the order
    }
}

//In this example, I've refactored the code to improve its usability 
//by using an int as the parameter for the order ID instead of string, 
//this is a more appropriate data type for an order ID and can be easily validated and handled.
