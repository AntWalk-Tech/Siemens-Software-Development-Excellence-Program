// Bad example
public class OrderProcessor
{
    public void ProcessOrder(string orderId)
    {
        // code to process the order
    }
}

// Good example
public class OrderProcessor
{
    public void ProcessOrder(int orderId)
    {
        // code to process the order
    }
}


//The bad example uses a string as the parameter for the order ID, 
//which could lead to issues with data validation and handling. 
//The good example uses an integer, 
//which is a more appropriate data type for an order ID and can be easily validated and handled.
