interface IWorkable
{
    void Work();
}

interface IFeedable
{
    void Eat();
}

class Human : IWorkable, IFeedable
{
    public void Work()
    {
        // code to work
    }
    public void Eat()
    {
        // code to eat
    }
}

class Robot : IWorkable
{
    public void Work()
    {
        // code to work
    }
}


// In this example, the Human class implements both IWorkable and IFeedable interfaces, but the Robot class only implements the IWorkable interface because it doesn't need to eat. 
//This way, the Robot class is not forced to implement the IFeedable interface and its methods that it doesn't use.
